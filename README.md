# FPGA based magnetic Levitation

This project is a verilog implementation of a FPGA controlled magnetic levitation system.

The objective of this project was to build a closed-loop control system on the Altera DE2-115 FPGA board to levitate a iron ball using magnetic levitation. We created the system using an electro magnet to pick up an iron ball and levitate it in the air between a horizontal resting spot and the metal core of the electromagnet. We used a TI LDC1000 EVM module as an inductive sensor to measure the distance the ball was hovering at.
